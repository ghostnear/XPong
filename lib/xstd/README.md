# XSTD

Part of the cross-platform Lua toolkit, XSTD provides an extension to Lua's standard library.

It is meant to be simpler and more light weight than the amazing [batteries](https://github.com/1bardesign/batteries/).

It also uses parts of the even better [knife](https://github.com/airstruck/knife). Noted where taken.
